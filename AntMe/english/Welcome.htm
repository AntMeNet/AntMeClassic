<p>An entirely new approach to learning programming: &quot;AntMe!&quot; is a simple but 
    sophisticated game centered around programming artificial intelligence (AI). It 
    is a great way to learn C# or Visual Basic, discover some of the &quot;magic&quot; of 
    computer games and have lots of fun along the way!</p>

<p><img src="images/samurai.png" alt="Samurai ant" width="162" height="217" style="float:right;" />Each player controls an ant colony searching for food in a virtual forest. Just like in real life, the amount of food is limited and there's a bunch of enemies, a.k.a. bugs, constantly on the lookout for their next meal &ndash; your ants.</p>

<p>If this doesn't yet sound all that exciting, how about this: the ants' behavior is based on a small program written by the player &ndash; i.e. <em>you</em> &ndash; before the game starts. Ants can be made to react to events in their environment such as spotting an enemy or discovering food. In the code you determine an ant's reaction to these events: should it attack the enemy or run away? Call other ants for help? What if there are none around?</p> 
<p>Clever programming and sophisticated strategies go a long way in helping your ants survive as best they can. After all, they're looking up to <em>you</em> to guide them in their daily lives.</p>
